## Software Models

Some well-known software models are as below:
  * WRSPM Model: 
    * World - Assumptions about what we are developing
    * Requirements - Defining our problem in generic easy to understand terms
    * Specifications - Defining the more technical details of the interface we are building
    * Program - The code, frameworks, development process, etc
    * Machine - The physical hardware we are running on

There are additional areas of classification we can use as well.
  * Eh - Environment hidden. These are pieces of data within the environment, which are just concepts or ideas. For example, the password you have memorized for an account. This piece of information exists only within your mind. Therefore it's a variable, but hidden.
  * Ev - Environment Visible. These are pieces of data within the environment which are now visible. Entering that password into a computer terminal manifests it. It is now represented in the physical world, and in a way which the system can now use.
  * Sv - System Visible. This is the part of the system which is visible to the user. This includes the program and the machine. So the keyboard, monitor, mouse etc. It also covers the screens and part of the program which you can interact with.
  * Sh - System Hidden. This is the part of the system which is hidden from the user. This includes the part of the software that the user doesn't touch, and the components within the machine itself. An example of this would be with a calculator. The user enters in the two numbers to be added. The hidden part is how the machine adds the numbers together before showing the result to the user.
