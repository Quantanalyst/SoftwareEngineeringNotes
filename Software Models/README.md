## Basic Definitions

**Technical debt**: A poor, hard to understand "hacky" implementation which will have to be repaid with interest later on. In other words, 1 hour saved now may cost 20+ hours later. 20% of projects fail. Many of these are due to poor development practices. 

**Software Development Life Cycle**:
  * Requirements: A process for finding out the goals of the system. A way of figuring out the exact specification of **what** the software should do. 
  * Design
  * Implementation: Code and documentation 
  * Verification (Test) : This stage is mostly determined by the requirements. So, the verification stage is a collection of unit and functional test designed to verify that the implemented code meet the requirements. 
  * Maintenance: create lifecyle plan( e.g. check the software every 6 months to see all technologies are up to date, etc) and fixing bugs
