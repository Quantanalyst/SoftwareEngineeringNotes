### Basic Definitions

**Technical debt**: A poor, hard to understand "hacky" implementation which will have to be repaid with interest later on. In other words, 1 hour saved now may cost 20+ hours later. 20% of projects fail. Many of these are due to poor development practices. 

**Software Development Life Cycle**:
  * Requirements: A process for finding out the goals of the system. A way of figuring out the exact specification of **what** the software should do. 
  * Design
  * Implementation: Code and documentation 
  * Verification (Test) : This stage is mostly determined by the requirements. So, the verification stage is a collection of unit and functional test designed to verify that the implemented code meet the requirements. 
  * Maintenance: create lifecyle plan( e.g. check the software every 6 months to see all technologies are up to date, etc) and fixing bugs 

**User Requirements vs. System Specification**: Requirement is a non-technical definition of something that is required from the system. Specification is a technical definition of what is required from the system. Specifications are in essence "technical requirements". They are used to define the problem in terms of the technical constraints.

**Non-Functional vs. Functional Requirements**: Functional requirements are requirements which pertain to the function of the system. Non-Functional requirements are requirements which cover areas that don't directly affect the function of the program.

Non-Functional requirements might have some subcategories:
  * Product requirements: Must haves of the product itself. Talk about behavior
  * Organizational requirements: Company policies, standards, rules, etc (e.g. Product data must be encrypted by AES 256, The project will be developed using the Scrum methodologies, ...) 
  * External requirements: External laws, regulations, trends, etc. 

## Software Models

Some well-known software models are as below:
  * WRSPM Model (World, Requirements, Specification, Program, Machine):
