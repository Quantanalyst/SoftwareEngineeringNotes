## Design - Modularity

Design has the following components:
  * Architecture 
  * High Level
  * Models
  * Coupling
  * Cohesion
  * Low Level
  * Modularity

Bewar **Design is not coding. Coding is not design!**


**Modularity** overview:
  * What should we pay attention to:
    * Coupling - How well modules work together
    * Cohesion - How well a module meets a singly designed goal
  * Goals of modularity:
    * Abstraction
    * Decomposability
    * Composability
    * Module understandability
    * Continuity
    * Protectability

**Information Hiding and Data Encapsulation** overview:
  * information hiding:
    * Hide complexity in a "black box" using Function, Macro, Library, Classes, and Methods
  * Data Encapsulation: 
    * Hide the implementation details from the user. Only provides a set of tools to manipulate the data. 

With it implemented properly, we don't need to know the entire codebase to make a change. We only need to know the part of the program we are working on. The encapsulation of all the other levels of the program, make things easy to test and change.
