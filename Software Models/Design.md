## Design

Design has the following components:
  * Architecture
    * Architecture is the very top level of design
    * Architects are the link between idea and reality
    * Architecture is something that cannot be fixed once implemented
    * (very important) in software, bad architecture is something that can't be fixed with good programming. 
  * High Level
  * Models
  * Coupling
  * Cohesion
  * Low Level
  * Modularity

**Architecture**:
  * Software architecture is all about breaking up larger system into smaller focused systems
    * Good Architure is hard
    * Maintainable software has good architecture
    * Architecture mistakes are **almost impossible to fix** once coding has begun
  * Good architecture allows for faster development, and smarter task allocation
    * Good architecture also allows the company to decide where to by and where to build
    * Reduces overall idle time
