# Array

**Definition:**
Array is a DS consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by array index. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index cell by a mathematical formula. 

Array is always on a contiguous memory location. This allows easy access. All array values have the same type. 

**Creating an array**:
  - Declare: creating a **reference** to array
  - Instantiate: create an array
  - Initialize: assign values to cells in the array

**When to use/avoid arrays?**
  - When to use:
    * When there is a need to store multiple similar type of data
    * When random access is regular 
  - When to avoid: 
    * When data is non-homogenous
    * When number of data to be stored is not known in advance 

Practical use of arrays:
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Hash Tables
