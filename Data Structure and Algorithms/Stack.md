# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

It is a useful DS when we need to create an application which utilizes 'last incoming data first', e.g. implementation of 'Back" button in browser.

When to use/avoid?
  - When to use:
    * Helps manage the data in particular way (LIFO)
    * Can not be easily corrupted (No one can insert data in the middle)
  - When to avoid:
    * Random access not possible - if we have done some mistake, it is costly to rectify.
